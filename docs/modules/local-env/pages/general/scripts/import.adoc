= Import OneCX Data
:idprefix:
:idseparator: -
:imagesdir: ../../../images

The *import-onecx.sh* script is used to import data needed by the OneCX services. It can be run from the root directory of the *onecx-local-env* repository. Here the command for importing the data for the essential services:

[source,bash]
----
./import-onecx.sh
----

.Successful import

== Available Flags
The script accepts several optional flags to customize its behavior. The available flags are:

-d::
Specify a set of data to be imported (all, base) or a specific data type like workspace, theme etc.
  * base (Default).
  * all
  * one of [ bookmark, assignment, parameter, permission, mfe, ms, product, slot, tenant theme, welcome, workspace]

-e::
The edition of OneCX. This must match the edition that was used to start the environment. Supported editions are:
  * v2 (Default).
  * v1

-h::
Displays help information about the script and its available flags. If used then all other options are ignored.

-s::
Security authentication enabled, default not enabled (value is inherited from start-onecx.sh)

-t:: Tenant, for tenant-specific imports (e.g. workspace, theme)
  * default (default)
  * t1
  * t2

-v:: Verbose: display details during import of objects
-x:: Skip checking running Docker services


== Examples

Import ALL data, tenant `default`::
Import all available OneCX data as:
* Non-tenant specific data
* Tenant data for `default` tenant
Before the import, a check is performed to ensure that all required services are already running. Any missing services are started.

[source,bash]
----
./import-onecx.sh -d all
----


Import specific data, skip check::
Only workspace data is imported. If the data are tenant-specific data then the default tenant is used (use flag *-t* for a different tenant)
Running services are not checked beforehand. If a required service is not running, the import will fail.

[source,bash]
----
./import-onecx.sh -d workspace -x
----


Import base data, tenant `t1`::
Import essential OneCX data as:
* Non-tenant specific data
* Tenant data for *t1* tenant
To import tenant-specific data, services with security authentication enabled must be running. Without the *-x* flag, Docker restarts the services with the security option enabled. A corresponding user exists for each tenant. The import is performed using this authorized user.

[source,bash]
----
./import-onecx.sh -t t1
----
