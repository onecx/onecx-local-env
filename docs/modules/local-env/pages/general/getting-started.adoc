[NOTE]
====
This guide assumes that *onecx-local-env* has already been set up and installed according to the instructions provided in xref:documentation:local-env:general/setup.adoc[Setup].
====

This guide provides a quick overview of the steps required to run a local OneCX environment. It includes instructions on starting the environment, accessing OneCX in a browser, and stopping the environment when finished.

== Starting the local environment

After setting up *onecx-local-env*, a local OneCX environment can be started by running a single command from the root directory of *onecx-local-env*.

[source,bash]
----
./start-onecx.sh
----

This command starts the minimal set of required Docker services and imports the necessary data for them to function. This process may take several minutes, especially on the first run, as Docker images may need to be pulled.

Successful starting::

[TIP]
====
The *start-onecx.sh* script accepts optional flags to customize its behavior. A list of available flags can be found in the xref:documentation:local-env:scripts/start.adoc[start-onecx.sh] documentation or by running

`./start-onecx.sh -h`.
====


== Accessing OneCX in a browser

After starting the local environment, OneCX can be accessed in a web browser by navigating to http://local-proxy/onecx-shell/admin[http://local-proxy/onecx-shell/admin].

The default login credentials are:

** Username: `onecx`
** Password: `onecx`


== Stopping the local environment

When finished using the local OneCX environment, it can be stopped by running the following command from the root directory of *onecx-local-env*:
[source,bash]
----
./stop-onecx.sh
----

[TIP]
====
The `stop-onecx.sh` script accepts optional flags to customize its behavior. A list of available flags can be found in the xref:documentation:local-env:scripts/stop.adoc[stop-onecx.sh documentation] or by running

`./stop-onecx.sh -h`
