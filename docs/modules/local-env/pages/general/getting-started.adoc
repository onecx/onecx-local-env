:idprefix:

This guide provides a quick overview of the steps required to run a local OneCX environment. It includes instructions on starting the environment, accessing OneCX in a browser, and stopping the environment when finished.

== Set up the local environment
Follow the instructions at xref:documentation:local-env:general/setup.adoc[Setup] to configure the base on your local machine. The following steps assume that *onecx-local-env* has already been configured and installed according to the installation instructions.


== Starting the local environment
After setting up *onecx-local-env*, a local OneCX environment can be started by running a single command from the root directory of *onecx-local-env*.

[source,bash]
----
./start-onecx.sh
----

This command starts the minimal set of required Docker services and imports the necessary data for them to function. This process may take several minutes, especially on the first run, as Docker images may need to be pulled.

[TIP]
====
The *start-onecx.sh* script accepts optional flags to customize its behavior. A list of available flags can be found in the xref:documentation:local-env:scripts/start.adoc[start-onecx.sh] documentation or by running

`./start-onecx.sh -h`.

== Accessing OneCX in a browser

After starting the local environment, OneCX can be accessed in a web browser by navigating to http://local-proxy/onecx-shell/admin[http://local-proxy/onecx-shell/admin].

The default login credentials are:

** Username: `onecx`
** Password: `onecx`

[source,bash]
----
./stop-onecx.sh
----

[TIP]
====
The `stop-onecx.sh` script accepts optional flags to customize its behavior. A list of available flags can be found in the xref:documentation:local-env:scripts/stop.adoc[stop-onecx.sh documentation] or by running

`./stop-onecx.sh -h`
