*onecx-local-env* is the local development environment for OneCX. It is based on Docker/Docker Compose, and enables developers to quickly run local instances of the OneCX Shell, selected OneCX products and their dependencies for development and testing purposes.

*onecx-local-env* can either be used as a standalone tool, or integrated into custom development environments via Git submodules. Custom development environments can interact with *onecx-local-env* via provided lifecycle-scripts and extend its functionality by wrapping the provided Docker Compose and script files with custom implementations.

== Use Scripts for Management

Since OneCX runs in a Docker Compose environment, most settings can be managed directly through Docker and Docker Compose.
However, for a more convenient approach and taking into account specific OneCX features, various shell scripts are available. Each script has the *-h* flag to explain how to use.
