There are several ways to expand the OneCX local environment:


== Integrate directly a local running Microfrontend

If a microfrontend has been started separately, integration can be easily accomplished through routing and path rewriting by xref:../utilities.adoc#traefik[Traefik].

Follow the instructions xref:./local-mfe.adoc[Integrate a local Microfrontend] to use your microfrontend directly in OneCX.

[TIP]
This is the recommended aproach to integrate a local running microfrontend. Please use this.


== Adding a custom docker-compose file

To integrate Docker images into OneCX, you need a separate docker.compose file to manage the integration.

Follow the instructions in xref:./local-images.adoc[Integrate Docker Images] to integrate your images into OneCX.
