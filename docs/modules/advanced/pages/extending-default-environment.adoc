= OneCX Local Env - Advanced - Extending the default environment
:idprefix:
:idseparator: -
:imagesdir: ../images

If you need to extend this environment with your own containers or import additional data, please utilize preferred version folder and its `docker-compose` and `imports` files and follow the guidelines from the respective version-specific documentation.

Please under no circumstances use the root `docker-compose.yaml` file or the root `imports` folder for your own extensions, as these files can change between versions and may break your setup.

== Adding and running new microfrontend (MFE)

In order to run the MFE all corresponding BFFs and all corresponding backend services (MS) need to run also.

=== Locally build docker image of the MFE

After a local docker image of the MFE is created, add it to the docker-compose and started as any other service.

=== Locally started in dev mode `npm start`

In order to use traefik and locally started MFE you need to enhance the npm start script located in package.json with `--host 0.0.0.0 --disable-host-check`

If it runs on the standard port _4200_ you don't need to do anything special as this is already configured for the local_mfe service under `./init-data/traefik/traefik-services.yml`
Only update the traefik config in `docker-compose.yaml`

_EXAMPLE_ for onecx-tenant-ui (its already part of the docker-compose in the part of onecx-tenant-bff)

[source,yaml]
----
      - "traefik.http.routers.local_mfe.entrypoints=web"
      - "traefik.http.routers.local_mfe.rule=Host(`local-proxy`)&&PathPrefix(`/mfe/tenant/`)"
      - "traefik.http.routers.local_mfe.service=local_mfe@file"
----

In order to get this working also the local proxy configuration of the MFE needs to be updated like this:

[source,javascript]
----
const PROXY_CONFIG = {
  '/mfe/tenant': {
    target: 'http://localhost:4200/',
    secure: false,
    pathRewrite: {
      '^.*/mfe/tenant': '',
    },
    changeOrigin: true,
    logLevel: 'debug',
    bypass: bypassFn,
  }
----
