[#adding-new-files]
== Adding New Files

To add new files to the `imports` directory, follow these guidelines:

1. **Naming Conventions** - use consistent naming patterns based on the type of data being imported. The patterns are listed in the <<convention-and-file-list, Convention and file list>> section.

2. **File Structure** - JSON files should adhere to the existing structure that is compliant with the respective service's API.

3. **Script Updates** - If adding a new type of data, add new import script that includes new files and uses the appropriate service. Make sure to define the structure of the JSON files.

4. **Testing** - Test the import process by running the relevant script and verifying the data in the environment.

By adhering to these conventions, you can ensure consistency and maintainability in the OneCX Local Environment.
