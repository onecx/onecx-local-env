= OneCX Local Env - Versions - v2 - Migrate to v2

This guide highlights the key differences between OneCX Local Env xref:general:versions/v1/v1.adoc[v1] and xref:general:versions/v2/v2.adoc[v2], and explains how you can adapt your setup to ensure that it seamlessly works with xref:general:versions/v2/v2.adoc[v2].

== Network Rename

In xref:general:versions/v1/v1.adoc[v1], the network that all services connected to was named `example`.  
In xref:general:versions/v2/v2.adoc[v2], this network is now named `default`.

If you have any custom services that need to attach to the same network as OneCX, make sure they connect to `default` from now on.


== Service Startup Behavior

In xref:general:versions/v1/v1.adoc[v1]:

- Some core services started automatically when running: `docker compose up -d`

- Additional services could be started using the two existing profiles: `all` and `parameters`.
- This approach gave developers very little control over which apps were started, making it hard to, for example, run only a small subset of apps and one OneCX product.

In xref:general:versions/v2/v2.adoc[v2]:

- The system is **fully profile-based**.
- **Nothing** starts by default when you run: `docker compose up -d`
- You must explicitly specify at least one profile, for example:

```bash
docker compose --profile base up -d
```
- Profiles allow fine-grained control over which services run.
- For details on available profiles, see xref:general:versions/v2/v2.adoc[the v2 documentation].

== Data Import Script Improvements

In xref:general:versions/v1/v1.adoc[v1]:

- The data import script had the sole purpose of sending data to services to trigger the import.
- This caused issues if containers were not running, unhealthy, or still starting up.

In xref:general:versions/v2/v2.adoc[v2]:

- The import script now:
  * Starts all required services.
  * Waits for them to become healthy and operational.
  * Imports the data.
  * Spins down the started services afterward.

This improves reliability for most developers.  
However, if you use the script inside another script that needs containers to remain running after import, you can disable container management by running the script using:

```bash
SKIP_CONTAINER_MANAGEMENT=true ./import-onecx.sh
```

This ensures the script does not start or stop any containers, allowing you to manage them manually. *Please be aware that in this mode, it's your responsibility to ensure that all required containers (Traefik, Postgres, Keycloak and all OneCX SVCs) are running and healthy before executing the script.*

== Moved ENV Files
Before the creation of xref:general:versions/v2/v2.adoc[v2], all environment variable files were located in the root directory of the project. To allow for better organization and scoped environment variables per version, all environment variable files are now located in the directory of the version they belong to (e.g., `./versions/v2/` for v2). As of right now, `./versions/v1/` and `./versions/v2/` contain identical `.env`, `bff.env` and `svc.env` files, but this may change in the future (e.g. if different image tags have to be used for different versions). If you or any of your scripts reference these files, please update the paths accordingly.

[NOTE]
.Checkpoint
====
After reading all sections of this document you should be able to make all necessary adjustments to migrate from v1 to v2 of the OneCX Local Env.
To recap, the main necessary adjustments are:
* Change any custom services that connect to the `example` network to connect to the `default` network instead.
* Change any scripts or commands that start services to use profiles instead of relying on default behavior.
* Adjust import scripts if you need to manage container states manually.
* Update paths to any `.env`, `bff.env` or `svc.env` files to point to the new locations in the respective version directory.
