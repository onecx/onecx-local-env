`onecx-local-env` is the local development environment for OneCX products. It is based on Docker and Docker Compose, and enables developers to quickly run local instances of the OneCX Shell, selected OneCX products and their dependencies for development and testing purposes.

`onecx-local-env` can either be used as a standalone tool, or integrated into custom development environments via Git submodules. To avoid introducing breaking changes for any existing workflows or custom environments, multiple versions of `onecx-local-env` exist in parallel.

For more in-depth information on `onecx-local-env` including prerequisites, setup instructions, available versions and more please refer to the following documentation:

- xref:general:getting-started.adoc[Getting Started - Run OneCX locally]

If you already followed all setup instructions mentioned in xref:general:getting-started.adoc[Getting Started - Run OneCX locally], you can complete the following steps to run and access a local OneCX environment:

. *Import mock data (optional):* Before starting the local environment, you can import mock data. If you recently followed the setup instructions, mock data should already be present. To (re-)import the latest mock data, run the following command from the onecx-local-env root directory: `./import-onecx.sh`

. *Start the local environment:* To start a minimal local OneCX environment, run the following command from the onecx-local-env root directory: `./start-onecx.sh`

. *Access your local OneCX environment:* Once the local environment is started, you can access the OneCX Shell by navigating to `http://local-proxy/onecx-shell/admin` in your web browser. Use the following default credentials to log in:

  - Username: `onecx`
  - Password: `onecx`

. *Stop the local environment:* After you are done working with your local OneCX environment, you can stop it by running the following command from the onecx-local-env root directory: `./stop-onecx.sh`
