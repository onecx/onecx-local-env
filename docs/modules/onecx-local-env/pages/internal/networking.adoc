= Networking in OneCX Local Environment

:different_ports: xref:documentation:onecx-docs-start/enable_hot_reload.adoc#note-different-ports
:ole_setup: xref:onecx-local-env:setup.adoc

This document explains how networking is configured and managed in the OneCX Local Environment.

[NOTE]
====
To isolate the local OneCX environment from the host system and other Docker environments, Docker uses the project name *onecx-local-env*. This project name serves as a prefix for all created Docker resources (containers, networks, volumes), ensuring seamless communication between all services while minimizing disruptions and conflicts.
====

== Overview

The OneCX Local Environment uses a sophisticated networking setup that combines:
[horizontal,labelwidth=30]
Traefik::                       Central reverse proxy and API gateway
Service Discovery and Routing:: Docker labels
Docker Compose Network::        Service-to-service communication  
Host file Configuration::       Domain name resolution


== Network Actors and Components
=== Traefik

Traefik serves as the central entry point for all HTTP traffic in the OneCX environment. It acts as:

[horizontal,labelwidth=20]
Reverse Proxy::        Routes incoming requests to appropriate backend services
Load Balancer::        Distributes traffic across service instances
Service Discovery::    Automatically detects new services through Docker labels
API Gateway::          Provides a single entry point for all microservices

Configuration::        The Traefik configuration is split across multiple files: +
* `init-data/traefik/base/traefik-conf.yml` +
  Main configuration
* `init-data/traefik/base/traefik-services.yml` +
  Static service definitions for local development
* `versions/<version>/docker-compose.<version>.yaml` +
  OneCX service registrations

Traefik Settings::     `traefik-conf.yml`
[source,yaml]
----
entryPoints:
  web:
    address: ":80"  # HTTP entry point
providers:
  docker:
    endpoint: unix:///var/run/docker.sock
  file:
    directory: /etc/traefik/active
    watch: true
----

Pls. aware the locations of Traefik configuration files are mapped as follows:
----
init-data/traefik/base/traefik-conf.yml  => /etc/traefik/traefik.yml
init-data/traefik/active                 => /etc/traefik/active
----

=== Service Discovery

Traefik Labels::

Services register themselves with Traefik using Docker labels:

.Traefik Label Patterns: SVC and BFF
[source,yaml]
----
labels:
  - "traefik.http.services.<service-name>.loadbalancer.server.port=8080"
  - "traefik.http.routers.<service-name>.rule=Host(`<service-name>`)"
----

.Traefik Label Patterns: UI
[source,yaml]
----
labels:
  - "traefik.http.services.<ui-service-name>.loadbalancer.server.port=8080"
  - "traefik.http.routers.<ui-service-name>.rule=Host(`local-proxy`) && PathPrefix(`/<app-path>/`)"
----


=== Service Routing Rules

Different routing patterns are used for different service types:

* Backend Services (BFF/SVC) and Infrastructure Services:
[source,yaml]
----
Host(`service-name`)
----

* Frontend Applications (UI):
[source,yaml]
----
Host(`local-proxy`) && PathPrefix(`/app-path/`)
----

=== Port Mapping Strategy

External Ports (Host → Container)::
Key external ports exposed to the host:
+
[cols="2,2,3"]
|===
| Service | Host Port | Purpose

| Traefik HTTP
| 80
| Main HTTP entry point

| Traefik Dashboard
| 8082
| Web UI for Traefik management

| Keycloak
| 8080
| Identity and access management

| PostgreSQL
| 5432
| Database direct access
|===

//
Internal Ports (Container → Container):: Services communicate internally using standard ports: +

[horizontal,indentSize=4]
Web Services::          Port 8080 (Quarkus default)
PostgreSQL::            Port 5432
Frontend Applications:: Port 8080 (Nginx)


=== Docker Compose Network
Here only the v2 edition is described. The v1 edition is similar but uses the `example` network.

Central configuration of the Docker Compose network is defined in `versions/v2/docker-compose.yaml`

.Network Configuration in Docker Compose
image::onecx-network-in-docker-compose.png[width=300]

The network alias used by the services is *onecx*. On project level the network is named *onecx-local-env_onecx*. This is also the name visible when executing `docker network ls`. See hint at the top of this document about the project name.


Network Features::
[horizontal]
Service-to-Service Communication:: Services can communicate using container names as hostnames
Automatic DNS Resolution::         Docker provides built-in DNS for container name resolution
Network Isolation::                Traffic is isolated from the host network and other Docker networks
Network Communication Patterns::   Services communicate using these patterns

[cols="2,3,3"]
|===
| Communication Type | Example | URL Pattern

| Frontend to BFF
| Shell UI → Shell BFF
| `http://onecx-shell-bff:8080`

| BFF to Service  
| Shell BFF → Theme Service
| `http://onecx-theme-svc:8080`

| Service to Database
| Theme Service → PostgreSQL
| `jdbc:postgresql://postgresdb:5432/onecx_theme`

| Service to Keycloak
| Any Service → Keycloak
| `http://keycloak-app:8080`

=== Host File Configuration
Check the {ole_setup}#hosts[hosts entries section] for detailed instructions.


=== Environment Configuration

Within the Docker Compose files, several environment variables are defined to manage settings for services:

.Environment Variables Settings in Docker Compose
[%collapsible]
====
include::./env-settings.adoc[]
====

.Environment Variables Settings
The source of the used environment variables is the `.env` file located in the version folder, e.g. `versions/v2/.env`, here the link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/onecx/onecx-local-env/refs/heads/main/versions/v2/.env[link to GitHub source file].

.Use Environment Variable Set for SVC with `multi-tenancy` awareness
[%collapsible]
====
[source,yaml]
----
  onecx-announcement-svc:
    ...
    environment:
      <<: *svc_multi_tenancy
      ...
----
====

.Use Environment Variable Set for SVC with `single-tenancy` awareness
[%collapsible]
====
[source,yaml]
----
  onecx-iam-svc:
    ...
    environment:
      <<: *svc_single_tenancy
      ...
----
====


== Access Patterns
=== External Access (Browser → Services)

OneCX Shell:: Main Entry Point
[horizontal]
Shell Admin Interface:: `http://local-proxy/onecx-shell/admin`
  * Default credentials: username `onecx`, password `onecx`
  * All OneCX applications are accessed through the Shell workspace navigation

==== Application Access
Applications are accessed via the Shell and workspace navigation. For example: +

[horizontal]
Workspace Management::  `http://local-proxy/onecx-shell/admin/workspace`
Workspace UI::          `http://local-proxy/mfe/workspace/`
Traefik Routing Rule::  `traefik.http.routers.<ui-service>.rule=Host(\`local-proxy\`) && PathPrefix(\`/mfe/*workspace*/\`)`


==== Infrastructure Services
See also the collection of utility services documented in xref:../utilities.adoc[Utilities].

[horizontal]
Keycloak::            `http://keycloak-app:8080` or `http://localhost:8080`
PgAdmin::             `http://pgadmin`
Traefik Dashboard::   `http://localhost:8082`


=== Internal Communication
Services communicate internally using container names:

[horizontal]
BFF calls services::            `http://<service-name>:8080`
Services call databases::       `jdbc:postgresql://postgresdb:5432/db_name`
All services authenticate via:: `http://keycloak-app:8080`


== Development Support
The xref:../extend/extend.adoc[Extend OneCX] documentation describes how local running services are integrated into the OneCX Local Environment.


== Security Considerations

=== Network Isolation

* Services are isolated within the Docker network
* Only necessary ports are exposed to the host
* Database is not directly accessible from outside (except via mapped port 5432)

=== Authentication Flow

1. Browser → Traefik (local-proxy) → Frontend Application
2. Frontend → Traefik → BFF Service
3. BFF → Keycloak (authentication)
4. BFF → Backend Services (with token)
