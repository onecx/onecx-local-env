= Docker Compose Profiles in OneCX Local Environment

{docker_compose_profiles_link} allow you to define different sets of services and configurations that can be activated or deactivated based on your development or testing needs. +
This concept is particularly useful in the OneCX Local Environment, where you might want to run only a subset of services for specific scenarios.

The concept of Docker Compose Profiles is limited. While it works well for starting subsets of services, it doesn't work in the same way for stopping those subsets.
  

== Used Compose Profiles

In OneCX Local Environment, the following Docker Compose profiles are defined:

base::
The *base* profile includes the essential services required to run the OneCX Local Environment.
+
It is useful for scenarios where you want to run a minimal setup without additional features or services.

all::
The *all* profile includes almost all available services in the OneCX Local Environment. +
Excepted are services that may require additional resources or are not commonly used in standard development scenarios.
+
This profile is ideal for comprehensive testing or development scenarios where you need access to all common features and services provided by OneCX.

ai::
The *ai* profile includes services related to AI functionalities within the OneCX Local Environment. +
Activate this profile when you want to test or develop AI-related features.
+
.The services in this profile...

* depend on the *base* profile, so ensure that the base services are running.
* require an App Key for AI services to function correctly. During import, you will be prompted to provide this key.
