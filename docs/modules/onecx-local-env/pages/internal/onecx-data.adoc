== How the Data are organized and imported
The directory *onecx-data* in the *onecx-local-env* repository contains all data files and scripts needed to import data into the OneCX Local Environment.

The xref:../scripts/import.adoc[import-onecx.sh] script is used to import data needed by the OneCX services. It can be run from the root directory of the *onecx-local-env* repository.
It starts several scripts that import data for the different services. All data files are in JSON format and usually related to a tenant or an application.

The import scripts are using *node.js* and *jq* for reading the data, split them in batches and call the respective service APIs to import the data.
Each script is responsible for importing a specific type of data, e.g. workspaces, themes, permissions, etc.
