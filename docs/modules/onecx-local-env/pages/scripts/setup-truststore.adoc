= Setup Java Truststore with Custom Certificates

The *setup-truststore.sh* script is used to create or update a Java Truststore containing custom certificates needed by Java applications running inside Docker containers in the OneCX Local Environment.

There are no parameters required. The script can be run from the root directory of the *onecx-local-env* repository:

[source,bash]
----
./setup-truststore.sh

Instructions for preparing the Java Truststore with your certificates can be found under xref:../internal/custom-certificates.adoc[Custom Certificates].
