= Running OneCX locally

This guide provides a quick overview of the steps required to run a local OneCX environment. It includes instructions on starting the environment, accessing OneCX in a browser, and stopping the environment when finished.

The following steps assume that *onecx-local-env* has already been configured and installed according to the installation instructions. If you have not done so yet, please refer to xref:./setup.adoc[Setting up] before proceeding.


== Starting OneCX
After setting up a local OneCX environment can be started by running a single command from the root directory of *onecx-local-env*.

[source,bash]
----
./start-onecx.sh
----

This command starts the minimal set of required Docker services and imports the necessary data for them to function. This process may take several minutes, especially on the first run, as Docker images may need to be pulled.

[TIP]
====
The *start-onecx.sh* script accepts optional options to customize its behavior. A list of available options can be found in the xref:./scripts/start.adoc#available-options[start-onecx.sh] documentation or by running

`./start-onecx.sh -h`
====


[#accessing-onecx]
== Accessing OneCX

After starting the local environment, OneCX can be accessed in a web browser by navigating to http://onecx.localhost/onecx-shell/admin[http://onecx.localhost/onecx-shell/admin].

The default login credentials for the admin user are:

* Username: `onecx`
* Password: `onecx`

[NOTE]
====
If the environment was started with only essential services, not all UI functions are available. This is not a bug, but by design. To start all services, start with

`./start-onecx.sh -p all`
====


== Stopping OneCX

When finished using the local OneCX environment, it can be stopped by running the following command from the root directory of *onecx-local-env*:
[source,bash]
----
./stop-onecx.sh
----

[TIP]
====
The `stop-onecx.sh` script accepts optional options to customize its behavior. A list of available options can be found in the xref:./scripts/stop.adoc[stop-onecx.sh] documentation or by running

`./stop-onecx.sh -h`
====


== Start OneCX Services

The script `xref:./scripts/start.adoc[start-onecx.sh]` allows you to start OneCX services using predefined profiles. Alternatively, you can of course start the services directly with Docker Compose. Due to the service dependencies defined in the Docker Compose file, it is sufficient to start only the top-level services; this will automatically start the dependent services as well.

.Example: Start all OneCX Theme Services
[source, bash]
----
docker compose up -d onecx-theme-ui
----

== Stop OneCX Services

Since the service dependencies defined in the Docker Compose file only work in one direction, you may also need to take care of the dependent services when stopping services.

.Example: Stop OneCX Theme UI Service only
[source, bash]
----
docker compose down onecx-theme-ui
----

.Example: Stop all OneCX Theme Services
[source, bash]
----
docker compose down onecx-theme-svc onecx-theme-bff onecx-theme-ui
----
