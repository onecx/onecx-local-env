There is an OneCX realm which contains all configurations needed by OneCX like users, roles, clients etc.

=== pgAdmin
https://www.pgadmin.org/[pgAdmin] is a popular, open-source administration and development platform for https://www.postgresql.org/[PostgreSQL] databases.

[TIP]
This service is optional, as it is not strictly necessary for OneCX to function. For a better user experience, use a native client directly on your computer.

* Username: *admin*
