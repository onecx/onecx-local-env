This document only contains information specific to v1 of the OneCX Local Environment. Please make sure to also read the xref:../run-onecx.adoc[*top-level getting started guide*] for general information and instructions that apply to all versions.

v1 was the initial version of the local development environment for OneCX. While it still works and will be maintained for some time to avoid breaking existing workflows, some significant quality-of-life improvements were implemented in xref:./v2.adoc[OneCX Local Environment v2]. We therefore encourage new users to start with xref:./v2.adoc[OneCX Local Environment v2].

To migrate from v1 to v2, please refer to the xref:./migrate.adoc[Migrate to v2] guide.

== Overview

v1 contains services for Traefik, Postgres, Keycloak and all currently existing OneCX products (SVC, BFF, UI). Some of these services are started by default, while others can only be started via specific profiles. For more details on the available services, profiles, environment variables, networks and volumes, please refer to the <<components>> section of this document.

== Running OneCX Local Environment v1

To start a minimal local development environment (Traefik, Postgres and Keycloak) together with OneCX Shell, OneCX Workspace and their dependencies, run one of the following commands:

- From the repository root:
+
[source,bash]
----
  docker compose -f versions/v1/docker-compose.v1.yaml up -d
----
- From the `versions/v1` directory:
+
[source,bash]
----
  docker compose up -d
----

To additionally start the OneCX Parameter product, use the `--profile parameter` flag:

- From the repository root:
+
[source,bash]
----
  docker compose -f versions/v1/docker-compose.v1.yaml --profile parameter up -d
----
- From the `versions/v1` directory:
+
[source,bash]
----
  docker compose --profile parameter up -d
----

To start all services defined in the compose file, use the `--profile all` flag:

- From the repository root:
+
[source,bash]
----
  docker compose -f versions/v1/docker-compose.v1.yaml --profile all up -d
----
- From the `versions/v1` directory:
+
[source,bash]
----
  docker compose --profile all up -d
----

== Stopping OneCX Local Environment v1

To stop the started services, run one of the following commands:

- From the repository root:
+
[source,bash]
----
  docker compose -f versions/v1/docker-compose.v1.yaml down
----
- Stop specific profile from the repository root:
+
[source,bash]
----
  docker compose -f versions/v1/docker-compose.v1.yaml --profile <profile-name> down
----
- From the `versions/v1` directory:
+
[source,bash]
----
  docker compose down
----
- Stop specific profile from the `versions/v1` directory:
+
[source,bash]
----
  docker compose --profile <profile-name> down
----

== Importing initial data

When starting OneCX Local Environment v1 for the first time, some initial data has to be imported to set up the environment correctly. To import the initial data, please follow these steps:

. Start the environment using the `all` profile (see <<running-onecx-local-env-v1>>).
. Wait for all services to be healthy.
. Wait for at least 30 seconds to ensure that all services are fully initialized and operational.
. Run the import script:
- From the repository root:
+
[source,bash]
----
  ./versions/v1/import-onecx.v1.sh
----
. Ensure that status messages for each step are green and indicate success.
  - If any step of the import fails, please verify that all services required for the import (Traefik, Postgres, Keycloak and all OneCX SVCs) are running and healthy.
    - If they are, please check the logs of the service that failed the import for potential issues. To do so run `docker ps` to get the container ID and `docker logs <container-id>` to view the logs.
    - If they are not, please start the missing services and wait until they are healthy before re-running the import script.
. After the script has completed successfully, all initial data has been imported and the environment is ready to use.

== Components

=== Services

- `traefik`
- `postgresdb`
- `pgadmin`
- `keycloak-app`
- OneCX Product Services:
  * Shell: `onecx-shell-ui`, `onecx-shell-bff`

  * Help: `onecx-help-svc`, `onecx-help-bff`, `onecx-help-ui`
  * Parameter: `onecx-parameter-svc`, `onecx-parameter-bff`, `onecx-parameter-ui`

=== Profiles

OneCX Local Environment v1 contains a few profiles that can be used to start additional services on top of the default set of services:

- `parameter` — starts the OneCX Parameter product services
- `all` — starts all services defined in the compose file

For details on how to use profiles, please refer to the <<running-onecx-local-env-v1>> section of this document.

=== Environment variables

All services are based on images defined in the `.env` file in the `versions/v1` directory. Services might also reference additional environment variables from the `.env`, `common.env`, `svc.env` and `bff.env` files in the `versions/v1` directory.

The `.env` file is always loaded automatically, while other env files are referenced by some services via the `env_file` directive.

Some services also define additional environment variables directly in the compose file.

=== Networks

- `example` — primary network used by OneCX Local Environment v1. All services connect via this network.

=== Volumes

OneCX Local Environment v1 mounts one global volume:

- `postgres` — volume used by `postgresdb` to persist its data across container restarts.

Additionally, some services (`traefik`, `postgresdb`, `pgadmin` and `keycloak-app`) mount local directories for initialization data.

== Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while using OneCX Local Environment v1, please refer to the xref:../help/common-issues.adoc[Troubleshooting - Common Issues] page for potential solutions and workarounds.
