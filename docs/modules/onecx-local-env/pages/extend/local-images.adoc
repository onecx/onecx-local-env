= Integrate Docker Images

If you need to extend this environment with your own containers or import additional data, please utilize preferred version folder and its `docker-compose` and `imports` files and follow the guidelines from the respective version-specific documentation.

Please under no circumstances use the root `docker-compose.yaml` file or the root `imports` folder for your own extensions, as these files can change between versions and may break your setup.
