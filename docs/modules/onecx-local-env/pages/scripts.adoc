= Scripts for more Ease

Since OneCX runs in a Docker Compose environment, most settings can be managed directly through Docker and Docker Compose.
However, for a more convenient approach and taking into account specific OneCX features, various shell scripts are available.

[TIP]
Each script has the *-h* flag to explain how to use.

The following table gives an overview of the available scripts in *onecx-local-env* root directory. +
