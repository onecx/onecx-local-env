> It is strongly recommended for new users to start with the current edition of OneCX Local Environment instead of v1, as it contains many improvements and new features that are not available in v1. The current edition also receives regular updates and maintenance, while v1 only receives critical fixes to avoid disrupting existing workflows.

Start here for the latest edition: [OneCX Local Environment](https://onecx.github.io/docs/documentation/current/onecx-local-env/index.html).
